# IoT-Smoke-Detector-
# Iot Somke Detector 
## Objective: This project aims to develop a cost-effective and reliable IoT-based smoke detection system to alert users to fire hazards.

## Introduction : 
### This project aims to develop a cost-effective and reliable IoT-based smoke detection system that can alert users to potential fire hazards. The system utilizes a flame sensor to detect infrared radiation emitted by flames. Upon detection, an Arduino Uno microcontroller processes the signal and activates a buzzer to alert users. The project leverages basic electronic components like breadboards, jumper cables, and a micro buzzer to create a functional and cost-effective smoke detection system.

## Problem Statement : 
### Traditional smoke detectors often have limitations in terms of early detection and remote monitoring. This project addresses these limitations by developing an IoT-based smoke detection system that can detect fires early and alert users remotely, potentially saving lives and property.
## So according to the above problem statement, I have built the machine learning model that will predict whether the Email or SMS is Spam or Not Spam.

### Components Used :
Hardware Components 
- Flame Sensor
- Arduino UNO
- Jumper Cables (All)
- Breadboard Small
- Breadboard Big
- Micro Buzzer
- Arduino USB Cable
  
Software Components 
- Arduino IDE

## Conclusion : This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of an IoT-based smoke detection system using an Arduino Uno microcontroller and a flame sensor.The system effectively detects flames and triggers an alarm, providing early warning and potentially preventing significant damage. 
### This is how I have created the IoT Smoke Detector using Arduino UNO
