# IoT-Smoke-Detector-
# Iot Somke Detector 
## Objective: 
This project aims to develop a cost-effective and reliable IoT-based smoke detection system to alert users to fire hazards.

## Introduction : 
This project aims to develop a cost-effective and reliable IoT-based smoke detection system that can alert users to potential fire hazards. The system utilizes a flame sensor to detect infrared radiation emitted by flames. Upon detection, an Arduino Uno microcontroller processes the signal and activates a buzzer to alert users. The project leverages basic electronic components like breadboards, jumper cables, and a micro buzzer to create a functional and cost-effective smoke detection system.

## Problem Statement : 
Traditional smoke detectors often have limitations in terms of early detection and remote monitoring. This project addresses these limitations by developing an IoT-based smoke detection system that can detect fires early and alert users remotely, potentially saving lives and property.
## So according to the above problem statement, I have built the machine learning model that will predict whether the Email or SMS is Spam or Not Spam.

## Components Used :
Hardware Components 
- Flame Sensor
- Arduino UNO
- Jumper Cables (All)
- Breadboard Small
- Breadboard Big
- Micro Buzzer
- Arduino USB Cable
  
Software Components 
- Arduino IDE
## Working 
1. Flame Detection: The flame sensor continuously monitors the surrounding environment for infrared radiation. When a flame is detected, the sensor generates an electrical signal.

2. Signal Processing:The Arduino Uno microcontroller receives the electrical signal from the flame sensor.The microcontroller processes the signal to confirm the presence of a fire.
   
3. Alarm Activation: Upon confirmation of a fire, the microcontroller activates the buzzer. The buzzer emits a loud sound to alert the user of the fire hazard.

4. Remote Notification (Optional): In advanced setups, the microcontroller can be connected to the internet through Wi-Fi or cellular networks. It can send alerts via SMS, email, or push notifications to inform the user about the fire.
   
## Conclusion : 
This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of an IoT-based smoke detection system using an Arduino Uno microcontroller and a flame sensor.The system effectively detects flames and triggers an alarm, providing early warning and potentially preventing significant damage. 

## I invite further research to explore the limitations and potential enhancements of this system.
